Greetings!

Currently this web app does not have any security measures to protect your files and
the server so using it on a local server is the way to go.
This means with basic 'tricks' your files can be accessed in and from the file system.
Hopefully in the near future a more secured and usable version of
this file manager will be published on the github.com/kavins14.

I hope you like it.

Any feedback is appreciated!
